# How my [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) looks like

Based on the dark theme from [@xplosionmind](https://github.com/xplosionmind/joplin-theme)

Modified to look more like the [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) on vscode.
Took some inspiration on the PHPStorm [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/jetbrains) theme.

- Added margins to the editor
- Add custom headers
- Custom notes separator
- Better reading experience (subjective)

## Todo

- [ ] Clean CSS
- [ ] persistent note-list active item color



## Installation

`userchrome.css` is used to style the entire app, `userstyle.css` is used to style the parsed markdown, instead.

In order to use these stylesheets, place them in `~/.config/joplin-desktop/`
